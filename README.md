# KNN-Classifier

KNN -> K Nearest Neighnor Classifier
For this I have used built in iris dataset which is present in sklearn library.
Iris flower dataset is contains 4 features,
1. Sepal Length
2. Sepal Width
3. Petal Length
4. Petal Width

And there are three labels,
1. Setosa (0)
2. Versicolor (1)
3. Vieginica (2)
